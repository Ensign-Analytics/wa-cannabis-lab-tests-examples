Since Œî9-THCA is a precursor to Œî9-THC, tracking its levels over time helps us understand product freshness and how far along the decarboxylation process has gone. Think of it as checking your bud‚Äôs potential before the heat hits.

This plot captures the cannabis chemistry ‚Äî THCA is THC before the hit. Heat and time convert this molecule from an inactive form into a psychoactive powerhouse. Tracking THCA gives you a glimpse of raw potential.

Why Do THCA and THC Trend Downward Over Time?
Here‚Äôs the story ‚Äî and it‚Äôs got more twist than a joint on a windy day üå¨Ô∏èüí®:

Product shelf life: Over time, cannabis products sitting in labs, warehouses, or shelves may degrade or lose potency, especially THCA converting to other forms or degrading entirely.

Seasonal manufacturing patterns: Early months (e.g., Jan‚ÄìApr) likely reflect fresh batches, post-holiday surges, or early-year restocking. Later in the year, you might see smaller or older inventory tested.

Infused Mixes as a category can have lower cannabinoid consistency due to ingredient blends or inconsistent lab homogenization. If more low-THC batches were tested later in the year, average values drop.

Testing or reporting changes: Different labs, changing methods, or shifts in compliance priorities might influence reported averages.

Increased CBD or alternative focus: Some brands shift formulations throughout the year toward less psychoactive content ‚Äî especially in the edible space.

You're watching decarboxylation in action ‚Äî and market dynamics layered on top. The trend downward from ~47% THCA to ~24% by December is real, and THC follows a similar decline. Call it ‚ÄúPotency Seasonality‚Äù, and yes, we just coined that. üòâ


Let's repeat for the CBD chemistry, focusing on:

- CBDA (Cannabidiolic acid ‚Äì the precursor)

- CBD (Cannabidiol ‚Äì the neutral, active form)

We'll:

- Filter and prep the data

- Reshape to long format

- Apply 7-day rolling average

- Plot smoothed trends side by side like we did for THC
```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Let's pull from lab_data_list giving a fresh start
lab_cbd_filtered <- lab_data_list %>%
  filter(inventory_type_sub_category == "Infused Mixes") %>%
  mutate(month = as.Date(sale_date_month)) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_cbda = mean(potency_cbda_perc_avg, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_cbd  = mean(potency_cbd_perc_avg, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  filter(!(avg_cbda == 0 & avg_cbd == 0)) %>%
  as_tsibble(index = month)

# Reshape to long and smooth
# Convert to long format
cbd_long <- lab_cbd_filtered %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(avg_cbda, avg_cbd), names_to = "cannabinoid", values_to = "percentage") %>%
  as_tsibble(index = month, key = cannabinoid)

# Rolling smoothing (7-day window)
cbd_smoothed <- cbd_long %>%
  group_by(cannabinoid) %>% 
  mutate(
    rolling_pct = slider::slide_dbl(percentage, mean, .before = 2, .after = 2, .complete = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Plot the data

  geom_line(linewidth = 1.1, na.rm = TRUE) +

What We‚Äôve Accomplished:

- Built precursor-product summaries (e.g., CBGA ‚Üí THCA ‚Üí THC ‚Üí CBN)

Modeled:

- CBN degradation over time (üíÄ stale weed detector)

- THCA vs THC trends (üå°Ô∏è decarb in action)

- CBD transformation over time (üå± calming chemistry)

Introduced a slider and tidytext-style smoothing.

Built a clean, repeatable pipeline for cannabinoid chemistry EDA.

Created visuals with real-world use cases that are useful to our clients‚úÖ
